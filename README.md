# Python Assignments Repository

## Description

This repository contains a collection of Python assignments, each focusing on different aspects of Python programming. The assignments include tasks like creating basic programs, implementing algorithms, working with data structures, and more. The goal of this repository is to practice Python programming and gain experience in problem-solving.

### Instructions for Each Assignment:
1. **Create a Python program** to solve a given problem or perform a specific task.
2. **Test your code** with sample inputs to ensure it works correctly.
3. **Submit the completed code** by uploading it to this repository on GitHub.

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific assignment, and inside the folder, you'll find the Python script (usually with a `.py` extension) that implements the solution.

## Example: Basic Calculator Program (Assignment 1)

### Description:
Create a simple Python program that asks the user to input two numbers and a mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
- Perform the operation based on the user's input and print the result.
- Example: If a user inputs 10, 5, and +, your program should display `10 + 5 = 15`.

### Objective:
This assignment is designed to practice:
- Working with user input.
- Implementing basic arithmetic operations.
- Experimenting with variables and data types in Python.

### Notes:
- Each Python assignment focuses on different concepts and techniques in Python.
- Make sure to upload the completed Python code to this repository.
- Follow best practices for code structure and comments.
